# JavaCanvas
Draw with java graphics in jframe

# YEA BUT HOW DO I GET STARTED?
Oh just download the entire repository.
<br>
You can also take only the Az.java file and use it, as long as you put it as the main class of a jFrame.
<br>
Happy hacking!

# How do i use it?
YOU STUPID PIECE OF HOURSE GARBAGE! HOW DARE YOU NOT READ THE CODE I PROVIDED! IT IS REALLY WELL WRITEN!
<br>
Well, you are here so i might as well be less of an asshole and explain it to you.
<br>
-You 📃initialize the variables that will change between frames in a certain sector of the code
<br>
-You can 🔁perform actions between frames in a specific part of the code
<br>
-Your 🧠🎨main logic is in a specific part of the code.
<br>
Yea you can 🔁perform actions between frames in the part where the 🧠🎨main logic is, but it's way cleaner when you do it there.

# Oh, but how do i draw?
That's easy.
Look at my f*ing examples.
But you can do cooler stuff with the g.Something functions.
Learn them yourself.
Essential ones are: g.fillRect, g.setColor, g.drawLine, g.drawImade (I provided no example for images)

# Yo, what do I need if i want to understand what i'm doing instead of blindly trying stuff?
Know Java, have a working compiler, know some essential JFrame concepts, know some math, and know some physics.
